### Common Issues in OneDrive for Business


- Sync issues are the most common within **OneDrive for Business**, and the Support and Recovery assistant will offer suggestions to avoid conflicts when possible (ex. Changing a file name to avoid invalid characters).

- If **OneDrive for Business** displays a yellow warning triangle, this indicates that the storage capacity as been exceeded.

- If your **OneDrive for Business** account exceeds the maximum storage limit for more than three months, the account will be frozen.
