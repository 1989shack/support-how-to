When Cloud Backups are created you choose how the system informs you about that
single backup's activity. On the **Preferences** page, you can select email
periodicity: **Daily**, **Weekly**, or **Both**.

1. Select frequency of emails:

    - **Weekly Notifications** - Check the box next to send a weekly summary by
        email of all backups and restores.
    - **Daily Notifications** - Check the box next to send a daily summary by
        email of all backups and restores.

2. Enter your email address.

3. Click the **Save Preferences** button.

You may cancel this setting by unchecking the respective boxes and click **Save
Preferences** button.
