Because you are a dedicated hosting customer, we issue notifications through the MyRack
Portal that informs when an upgrade, patch, or other maintenance is available for your
devices. You can schedule when you want us to complete that work for you.

When a device requires maintenance:

- We issue a notification in the MyRack Portal informing you of the maintenance
- You receive an email informing you that maintenance is available

### Schedule device maintenance

1. Upon receiving a maintenance notification or email, click the **Click here to schedule maintenance** link and log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://my.rackspace.com/).
   The **Automated Maintenance** page appears. The **Automated Maintenance** page includes:
    - A list of all devices that require maintenance.
    - Filters on the left that enable you to refine the list of devices by status, data center location, and hardware type.
    - A search option that enables you to locate a specific device.

2. To view more information about a device and the reason it requires maintenance, click the device number.
   The device panel expands and shows important information about the device, including:
    - The name of the vulnerability
    - The device type and model
    - The current and suggested versions

   You can also click a link to see the associated notification in the MyRack portal.

3. To schedule maintenance, click the cog icon to the left of the device number and select **Schedule Maintenance**.
4. Select a date and time for the maintenance to begin, click the acknowledge checkbox, and click
**Schedule Maintenance**.
   
   Behind the scenes, we prepare your device for maintenance. We continuously
   update the notification available in the MyRack Portal to let you know where we are
   every step of the way.

5. To cancel or reschedule the maintenance, click the cog icon to the left of the device number and
select **Cancel** or **Reschedule**.
