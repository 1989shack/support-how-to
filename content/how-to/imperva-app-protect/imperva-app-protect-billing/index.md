The Imperva App Protect service is billed in the following way:

- Imperva App Protect with Rackspace Managed Services is available for
  Rackspace Managed Hosting, Private, and Public Cloud customers on a term
  contract of 12 months or more.

- Imperva App Protect with Rackspace Managed Services is available for
  Rackspace Cloud Infrastructure customers (“Cloud Infrastructure” means the
  supported Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform
  platforms as listed in Platforms Supported).

- Rackspace Technology shall bill all Rackspace Customers with Imperva App
  Protect with Rackspace Managed Services automatically through the Fastlane
  API.

- Rackspace Technology shall commence billing and the Customer agrees that
  fees shall be due for the Services no later than 60 days following the
  Customer’s acceptance of the applicable agreement for the Services
  (provided Rackspace Technology has completed a minimum deployment).

- Rackspace Technology shall identify the amount on the Service Order as the
  fees for a minimum deployment only.

- Rackspace Technology shall bill the Services based upon the subscription
  selected at point of initial sale until the Customer upgrades or modifies
  that agreement.

  **Note**: Downgrades cannot be made within the initial term.

Due to billing variability in the services, Rackspace Technology might
designate these services as a utility. Utility billing should not be confused
with the Customer’s Service Term, during which period the Customer is obligated
to the Customer’s contract with Rackspace Technology for these services.
