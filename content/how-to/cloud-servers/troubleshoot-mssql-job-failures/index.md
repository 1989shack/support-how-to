This article describes common reasons for SQL Server job failures and basic troubleshooting steps to investigate them.

### Common causes for job failures

SQL jobs can fail due to multiple reasons. To troubleshoot these failures, you can review the SQL Server Agent job history. To view these logs, open **SQL Server Management Studio** (SSMS) and connect to the corresponding database instance. Navigate to **Management** -> **SQL Server Logs** -> **SQL job name**. Find the job failure event and review the log details. The error logs should help you to determine if one or more steps of the job failed.

You can also configure jobs to export their logs to an external output file for detailed review. This can be configured in the **Advanced** tab of the job’s properties.

Following are a few common reasons for SQL job failures: 

#### Permission or authentication issues

The SQL Server Agent service is the Windows service required to perform SQL jobs. Job failures can happen if the user/service account that the service runs under has insufficient permissions to, for example, network shares or file locations. To verify this, click on the Windows button in your task bar and type **Services**. Locate the **SQL Server Agent** service, right-click and review the account information in the **Log On** tab.

Similar to Windows services, SQL Agent Jobs are executed under a user or service account configured in the job. Job failures can occur when there are permission or authentication issues with the user/service account. Common issues are:
-	Account expired
-	Password incorrect
-	Insufficient permissions to resources
-	Account no longer exists

Review the job failure log details in SSMS to get more information about the specific error or permission issue. You can change the account under which the job is run by right-clicking on the job. Navigate to the **General** tab and change the account under **Run as:**.

#### System resources are unavailable

Job failures can occur when certain resources are not available at the time of the job execution. Examples for this are:
-	Insufficient disk space 

-	High memory utilization

-	High CPU utilization

-	Network connectivity issues

#### Job is configured incorrectly

Job failures can also occur if the job is configured incorrectly. You can review the job configuration by right-clicking on the job and selecting **Properties**.  When maintenance plans are deleted, any jobs included are not deleted automatically. These have to be deleted separately to avoid job failures. Additionally, the job configuration might point to system resources that no longer exist or an incorrect file/network path.
