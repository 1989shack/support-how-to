# How to Install the WSUS server role:

Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), previously known as Software Update Services (SUS), is a computer program and network service developed by Microsoft Corporation that enables administrators to manage the distribution of updates and hotfixes released for Microsoft products to computers in an environment.

WSUS uses seven services. They are the Update Service (wsusservice.exe), the Reporting Web Service, the API Remoting Web Service, the Client Web Service, the Simple Web Authentication Web Service, the Server Synchronization Service, and the DSS Authentication Web Service.
