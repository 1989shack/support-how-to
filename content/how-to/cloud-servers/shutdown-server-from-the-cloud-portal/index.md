This article describes how to shutdown a Rackspace Cloud Server from the Control Panel.

**NOTE:** Because Cloud Server pricing is based on the hours that the server uses resources on the host machine, shutting down a server is not enough to stop billing. In order to completely prevent any further charges incurred from this server, it must be deleted.

# Shutdown Server

1. Log in to the Rackspace Portal: [https://login.rackspace.com/]

2. From the Select Product menu, navigate to **Select a Product > Rackspace Cloud**

3. Under the Servers menu, navigate to **Servers > Cloud Servers**

4. Click on the gear icon next to the server you wish to shutdown and select **Shutdown Server...**

5. In the pop up dialog box, select **Shutdown Server**.

**Note:** After initiating the Shutdown, please allow 3-5 minutes for the status to change from Active.
