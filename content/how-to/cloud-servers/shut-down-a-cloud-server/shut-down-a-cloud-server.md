Cloud Server pricing is based on the hours that the server uses resources on the
host machine. Due to this billing model, shutting down a server is not enough to
stop billing. 

To shut down a Linux&reg; server, run the following command at the command prompt:

`shutdown -h now`

To shut down a Windows&reg; server, open a command prompt and run the following command:

`shutdown`

After the shutdown command is executed, it takes a few minutes for the Cloud
Control Panel to show that the instances are offline, but no attempts to connect
to the server are accepted during the shutdown. After the shutdown completes,
you can determine whether the server is needed by noting whether the any users
or processes need the server.

If you determine that the server is still needed, reboot the server by clicking the gear icon in
the Cloud Control Panel and selecting **reboot**.

To retain data for possible future needs, create a 
[Cloud Server Image] (https://support.rackspace.com/support/how-to/creating-an-image-backup-cloning/)
for Standard and General Purpose server flavors.

For boot-from-volume servers, and servers where only specific files need to be
saved, use [Cloud Backup] (https://support.rackspace.com/support/how-to/rackspace-cloud-backup-create-a-backup/).

Both Cloud Server images and Cloud Backups are stored in Cloud Files with
associated storage costs, but for individuals who want to minimize their costs,
these two options are likely much cheaper than a running an idle server.
