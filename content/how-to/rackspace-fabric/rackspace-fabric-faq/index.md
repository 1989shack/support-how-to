{{<accordion title="How can I reset the password of my Email?" col="in" href="accordion1">}}

If you're a cloud account administrator, go to https://account.rackspace.com/event-history. It should support users in knowing any recent modifications or account access.

{{<accordion title="How can I return back to my previous ticketing application?" col="in" href="accordion2">}}
Rackspace is deactivating the former ticketing component and migrating clients to Fabric Ticketing, which has been utilized by multi-cloud users for some time. New features and customer feedback enhancements are gradually being integrated in the new Fabric Ticketing application.

{{<accordion title="I am not able to login to MyRack portal. I have been asked for MFA verification though I have not configured MFA yet." col="in" href="accordion3">}}
MFA is mandatory for all customers but should allow customer to configure it. In case to remove the MFA please contact identity team. To configure MFA, refer to [Multi-Factor-Authentication](/support/how-to/multi-factor-authentication)

{{<accordion title="I am not getting email notification via My Rackportal for incidents pertaining to Alert Logic." col="in" href="accordion4">}}
You will receive the notification if the device in question is enabled in the **Notification Preference** option. To check the preference option, refer to [Notification-Preference](/support/how-to/notification-preference).

{{<accordion title="I am unable to login to MyRack Portal. While login it is showing no primary contact exists." col="in" href="accordion5">}}
Create a new ticket in the fabric ticketing app under the category **Account** and select **User Management** as the account type. Contact your Admin or follow up with the support team or Account Manager if you are unable to log into the portal.

### Permission

{{<accordion title="I am unable to edit a ticket. I am getting the notification as I don't have permission to update." col="in" href="accordion2">}}
Contact an admin (customer side) or contact the Customer Success Manager or Support Team.
{{</accordion>}}

{{<accordion title="How can I update device name in Vcenter by removing Devices IDs?" col="in" href="accordion5">}}

{{</accordion>}}

{{<accordion title="I am not able to generate PIN via Rackspace portal." col="in" href="accordion6">}}

According to the instructions here: [Support Pin Management](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/support-pin-management/), you should be able to unlock the PIN via the portal. If you are unable to do so, you should contact the customer identity team, which is where the PIN is kept. However, bare in mind that this is a security measure. Without a proper verification of the customer's identity, no action should be performed to subvert it.
