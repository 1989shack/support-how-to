You can use the **Suppressed Alerts** log to review alerts that were
muted but ordinarily would have prompted notifications.

It is good practice to check the list of suppressed alerts after a
suppression period ends to confirm that everything that was suppressed
relates to the purpose of the suppression. For example, if all alerts
were suppressed during a scheduled maintenance period, alerts related to
servers that were not expected to be disrupted should be investigated.

To learn more about an entity, notification plan, or suppression in the
log, click its name. If it has not been deleted, you can then see its
detailed description.
