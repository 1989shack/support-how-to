### MyRackspace Portal 

This article explains how to use a ticket template to reset the password for an Active Directory user.

#### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace Portal

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/login) with your username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, choose **Select a Product** > **Dedicated Hosting**.

3. Select **Tickets** > **Create Ticket**. The Create New Ticket page displays. 

4. Select the Subject field.

5. Fro the dropdown menu, Select **Reset User Password on Active Directory Domain**.

5. Enter the username and Domain of the user account for which you would like to reset the password. 

    **Note:** Once the request has been completed, a secure password will be automatically generated for this user and provided in the ticket. You can change this password later if desired.

6. Select **Create Ticket**.

    **Note:** After the ticket is created, you will be redirected to your ticket list in the MyRackspace Portal. It typically takes a few minutes for the ticket creation process to complete.
