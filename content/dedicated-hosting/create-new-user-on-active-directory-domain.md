### MyRackspace Portal 

This article explains how to use a ticket template to add a new Active Directory user.

#### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace Portal

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/login) with your username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, choose **Select a Product** > **Dedicated Hosting**.

3. Select **Tickets** > **Create Ticket**. The Create New Ticket page displays. 

4. Select the Subject field.

5. From the dropdown menu, Select **Create New User on Active Directory Domain**.

5. Specify a username for the account you would like to create. 

    **Note:** Once the request has been completed, a secure password will be automatically generated for this user and provided in the ticket. You can change this password later if desired.

6. Specify a domain for the user.

**Note:** Use the "Give this user Administrative or sudo permissions" checkbox to grant the user administrative or sudo permissions. This will automatically add the user to Domain Administrator groups.

**Note:** Use the "Additional Instructions" box to provide additional information such as user details or group membership permissions.

9. Select **Create Ticket**.

    **Note:** After the ticket is created, you will be redirected to your ticket list in the MyRackspace Portal. It typically takes a few minutes for the ticket creation process to complete.
