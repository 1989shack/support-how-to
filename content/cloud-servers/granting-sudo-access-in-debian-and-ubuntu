This article goes over the steps necessary to grant a Linux user sudo/admin access on a Debian or Ubuntu server. 


### Prerequisites
You need to have the following prerequisites:
- Basic understanding of Secure Shell (SSH)
- Sudo or administrative access to your server
- A Cloud Server running Debian or Ubuntu based distributions.


### Granting sudo/admin permissions in Debian/Ubuntu
The following methods can be used to grant a user sudo level permissions on a default Debian/Ubuntu system.

On a Debian/Ubuntu server, the default group `admin` is granted sudo permissions. In order to add a user to this group and grant a user sudo permissions, run the following command:

       usermod -aG admin <user>

You can verify the user was added to the `admin` group by running the following command:

       id <user> 

If the user was successfully added, you should see the `admin` group listed in the groups section.

### Modifying the sudoers file
Another method of granting sudo permissions on a Linux server is by modifying the `/etc/sudoers` file to include the desired user. This allows for direct control per user rather than by adding a user to a group. 

**Warning**: Editing the `/etc/sudoers` file can de destructive to the server and potentially lock you out if there is any incorrect syntax in the file. Exercise caution when modifying this file. 

To edit the `/etc/sudoers` file, the recommended method is to use the `visudo` command. 

Once the file is open, add the following line to the bottom of the file:

       <user> ALL=(ALL)		ALL

Once the change has been made, save and exit the file. This will grant the user sudo permissions without adding the user to the wheel/admin group.
