Sometimes you need to change the primary user (also known as the *account owner*)
for Rackspace Cloud and AWS accounts through the [My Cloud portal](https://login.rackspace.com),
such as when a user leaves the company or the company or project name changes.

**Note**: Only the current account owner can assign a new account owner.

When you change the account owner, the following events occur:

- You must select the new or promoted user from existing users on the account.
  The selected user becomes the primary contact and has full control over the
  account.
- The former or demoted primary user is set as an Administrative contact type
  and given basic RBAC Identity permissions. You might need to set up RBAC
  permissions for the demoted user, depending on the use case.

### Change the account owner

Use the following steps to change the account owner through the Cloud
Control Panel interface.

1. Log in to the [Cloud Control Panel](https://login.rackspace.com).

2. In the top navigation bar, click the account icon next to your user name in
   upper-right corner and click **Account Settings**.

3. Click **Update** next to **Account Owner**.

4. In the list of available users, click the radio button for the user that
   you want to assign as the new account owner.

5. Add the account owner's address and click **Submit**.

6. When prompted to confirm the account update, type **CONFIRM** in the text
   box and click **Complete**.
