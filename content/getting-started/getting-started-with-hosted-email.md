This article guides you through creating, managing, building, and growing your Rackspace Hosted Email account. This guide is designed to remove the complexity of getting started on your first Public Cloud projects. We recommend completing tasks in the following order:

1. [Create an account](#create-an-account).
2. [Manage and secure an account](#manage-and-secure-an-account).
3. [Create mailboxes](#create-mailboxes).
4. [Migrate your email](#build-your-cloud).
5. [Configure your domain to receive email](#configure-your-domain-to-receive-email).
6. [Configure desktop and mobile devices](#configure-desktop-and-mobile-devices).

#### Create an account

Before addressing tasks such as securing your account, creating mailboxes, and even migrating users, an account must be created to house the email solution your business relies on. We have created this brief instructional document to walk you through [creating your Rackspace Hosted Email account](/how-to/sign-up-for-rackspace-services/#rackspace-email-or-microsoft-exchange) as easily as possible.

#### Manage and secure an account

Now that you have created an account, there are a few things you should do to prevent surprises.

1. Protect your account by enabling [Multi-factor authentication](/how-to/multi-factor-authentication-from-the-cloud-control-panel/) for yourself and your administrators.

2. [Add administrators](/how-to/manage-email-administrators-with-the-cloud-office-control-panel/#add-an-administrator) to help manage your account. You should consider who needs access to technical or billing portions of the account and assign them the appropriate permissions.

3. Learn how to monitor your account's [billing activity](/how-to/view-invoice-history-cloud-office-control-panel/) to ensure resources are being allocated efficiently.

#### Create mailboxes

Your account is now ready for you to create mailboxes. Before your email data can be migrated and your users can begin enjoying their new email solution, their new mailboxes must be created. Listed below are short instructions for creating Rackspace Email or Microsoft Exchange&reg; mailboxes:

- [Create Rackspace Email mailboxes](/how-to/add-rackspace-email-mailboxes/)
- [Create Microsoft Exchange mailboxes](/how-to/add-microsoft-exchange-mailboxes/)

#### Migrate your email

Migrating email data can be tedious if you do not have a roadmap to follow from start to finish. Our migration process offers many useful tools as well as robust instructions to make the transition as quick as possible. See our comprehensive guid on Rackspace Hosted Email [migration services](/how-to/email-migration-services/) to see which plan is your best fit.

#### Configure your domain to receive email

Once your mailboxes have been created, it is time to adjust your domain to deliver email to your new Rackspace Hosted Email mailboxes. This process can seem intimidating but can be accomplished by users of all technical levels using our step by step instructions. The steps in the article [Set up DNS records for Rackspace Hosted Email](/how-to/set-up-dns-records-for-cloud-office-email/), set you up for a successful email host transition.

#### Configure desktop and mobile devices

When your email migration has completed, and your users are ready to start receiving email to their desktop and mobile email clients, they can find detailed instructions for many of the most popular devices using our [Email Help Tool](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com). This tool walks the user through an interactive portal that asks a series of questions, leading them to their device specific email configuration instructions. To use the tool they navigate to emailhelp.rackspace.com and log in using their Rackspace Hosted Email email address and password.
