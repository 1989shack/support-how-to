Occasionally, account managers need to invite new users to access an account.
This article covers this workflow from both the account manager's perspective
and the new user's perspective.

If you're an account manager see the **Account manager** section.  If you're a
new user and you've received a invitation to register, see the **New user**
section.

### Account manager

If you're an account owner, use the following steps to create a new user for
your account:

1. In the upper-right corner of the Control Panel, click **Account > User Management**.
2. Click **Create User** in the **Users** tab of the **Users & Permissions** screen.
3. Fill out the form and click **Create User**.

The system automatically sends an email invitation to the user.

**Note**: A *Pending invitation acceptance* banner displays on the
**User Details** screen until they accept the emailed invitation and register.

### New user

If you're a new user and you've received an email invitation to join an account,
use the following steps to register:

1. Click the **Register User** link in the invitation email.
2. On the **Register Your Account** screen, fill in your new account details,
   including a username and password and click **Submit**.
3. After you are redirected to the **Log In** screen
   ([login.rackspace.com](https://login.rackspace.com)), login with your ID
   and password.

If you receive a **Link already used** error message when you click **Register**
in your invitation email, contact the account manager for a new invitation.
