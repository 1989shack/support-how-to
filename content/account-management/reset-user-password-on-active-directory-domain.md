### MyRackspace Portal 

This article describes how to reset the password for an Active Directory user by using a ticket template.

#### Create a ticket in the MyRackspace Portal

1. Log in to the [MyRackspace Portal](https://login.rackspace.com/login) using your username and password.

2. In the top navigation bar, click **Select a Product** > **Dedicated Hosting**.

3. Select **Tickets** > **Create New Ticket**. The Create New Ticket page displays. 

4. Select the Subject field.

5. Select **Reset User Password on Active Directory Domain** from the dropdown menu. 

5. Enter the username and Domain for the user account needing the password reset. 

    **Note:**A secure password for this user will be generated automatically and provided in the ticket once the request has been completed. You may change this password later if desired.

6. Select **Create Ticket** at the bottom of the page.

    **Note:**After the ticket is created, you will be redirected to your ticket list in the MyRackspace Portal. Automation runs in the background while the ticket is created, which typically takes a few minutes to complete.
