Rackspace now uses a PIN system to verify customer identity when a customer calls in to receive support.
This article discusses frequently asked questions about this process.


### Support PIN FAQ's

#### Why did Rackspace make the change to start using support PINs?

Support PINs are more secure and less easy to social engineer. ​
Support PINs provide a mechanism for Federated Users to be verified for Phone Support. ​
Support PINs can be reset in the event of a malicious attempt to an individual user or an account wholly. ​
Support PINs are more uniform in nature, require fewer judgment calls by Rackers to determine whether to verify a User. ​

#### What is a support PIN?​

- A support PIN is the Customer Secret that will be used to verify a Customer’s identity when calling in for technical, billing, and/or account management support. ​


#### Who needs a Support PIN?​

- Any customer user that needs to call into Rackspace support. Excluding: Cloud Office & Legacy DataPipe. ​

#### Who has a Support PIN?​

- Any customer user / contact that is active in the Rackspace Identity system will be given a six-digit generated Support PIN. This includes Dedicated Contacts and Cloud Users. Formerly DataPipe and Cloud Office customers will not be assigned Support PINs at this time. ​

#### Where can customers locate their Support PIN?​

- All Customer Users can find their Support PIN on their respective portals (MyRack, MyCloud) and Mobile app, under the User Management section.  ​

#### Can customers change their Support PIN?​

- Customer Users can change their pin at any time unless their Support PIN is locked ​

#### Are there any requirements for Support PIN? ​

- 6 digits in length ​

- 0-9 numeric digits​

- No repeating digits for more than 3 places​

- No sequential sequences for more than 3 places​
​
#### How are we protecting our Customers against Social Engineering? ​

- Identity has a counter that records the number of incorrect PIN attempts. ​

- When 6 consecutive incorrect Support PINs are entered by Rackers in Encore Interactions the User Support PIN will be in a  “Locked” status in the Identity API.​
​
#### My Customer Support PIN is locked what does that mean? ​
 ** Customers will still be able to login to their Portals; the Portal Password and Support PIN are completely separate and are not tied to each other. ​
To Unlock the Support PIN the customer will need to log into the Portal and take the Unlock action in the User Management Section. ​
Once the Support PIN is Unlocked the Customer can call in for phone support. ​
​
#### What if the Customer forgets their Support PIN?​

 - The Customer User can log into the Portal and view their Support PIN. ​
