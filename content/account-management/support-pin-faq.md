### Support PIN FAQ's

#### What is a support PIN?​

- A support PIN is the Customer Secret that will be used to verify a Customer’s identity when calling in for technical, billing, and/or account management support. ​

#### Why is Rackspace using support PINs?

- Support PINs are more secure and better protected against social engineering. ​
- Support PINs provide a mechanism for Federated Users to be verified for phone support. ​
- Support PINs can be reset in the event that an individual user or a whole account is attacked. ​
- Support PINs are uniform, and leave no room for interpretation when verifying a customer's identity. ​

#### Who needs a support PIN?​

- Any customer that is calling Rackspace support. This excludes Cloud Office & Legacy DataPipe customers. ​

#### Who has a support PIN?​

- Any Rackspace account user or contact that is active in the Rackspace Identity system is given a six-digit generated support PIN. This includes dedicated contacts and cloud users. Accounts that were formerly DataPipe and Cloud Office customers will not be assigned support PINs at this time. ​

#### Where can customers locate their support PIN?​

- All Rackspace account users can find their support PIN within the MyRack, MyCloud, and the mobile app, under the **User Management** section. See [View or edit an administrator's Support PIN](/how-to/support-pin-management/#view-or-edit-an administrators-support-pin) for detailed instructions on viewing a Support PIN.

#### Can customers change their Support PIN?​

- Yes, Rackspace account users can change their pin at any time unless their Support PIN is locked. See [View or edit an administrator's Support PIN](/how-to/support-pin-management/#view-or-edit-an administrators-support-pin) for detailed instructions on changing a Support PIN.

#### How does a support PIN protect your account against social engineering? ​

- The support PIN enters a locked status if support is provided an incorrect support PIN six times in a row. This means if someone calls support posing as one of your users, they will be unable to receive support without the correct PIN.

#### My customer support PIN is locked what does that mean? ​
Customers will still be able to login to their Portals; the Portal Password and Support PIN are completely separate and are not tied to each other. To Unlock the Support PIN the customer will need to log into the Portal and take the Unlock action in the User Management Section. ​Once the Support PIN is Unlocked the Customer can call in for phone support. ​See [Unlock an administrator's Support PIN](/how-to/support-pin-management/#unlock-an-administrators-support-pin) for detailed instructions on changing a Support PIN.

#### Are there any requirements for Support PIN? ​

- Six digits total ​

- 0-9 numeric digits​

- No repeating digits within three spaces of each other

- No sequential sequences for more than 3 places​<!--- not sure how to phrase this --->
​
#### What if I forget my support PIN?​
