The primary contact for an account must be an active user. You can update the primary contact by using one of the following methods:


#### Select new primary contact in control panel

1. Log in to the [Cloud Office Control Panel](https://cp.rackspace.com).

2. Click your account number in the upper right-hand corner and select **Administrators** from the dropdown menu.

3. Click the **MANAGE** button that corresponds with the administrator that you plan to make the primary contact of the account.

4. Click  the **MAKE PRIMARY CONTACT** button.

5. You are now prompted with a dialogue box titled **Change Primary Contact**. Review the message and click **YES, CHANGE THE PRIMARY CONTACT** to complete the process.

You have successfully changed the Primary Contact of the account.

Request a primary contact change
If you are not the primary contact or unable to select a new primary contact, a primary contact change can be requested.  The requester must contact Rackspace support to initiate this process.  After the request is approved the requester will be added as an administrator and set as the primary contact.
The new administrator must complete the following to finalize the process.


1.	In the welcome email click the Password Recovery link.
2.	Set a password for your Administrator ID.
3.	Complete the Multi-Factor Authentication Setup.
4.	Create a security question and answer for your Administrator ID.
