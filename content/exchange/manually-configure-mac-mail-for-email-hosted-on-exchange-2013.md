This article describes how to set up your Microsoft&reg; Exchange&reg; 2013
email account with Mac&reg; Mail&reg;.

**Note:** Exchange 2013 is only supported on the Mac operating system(OS) version 10.11 El Capitain&reg;  or later Mac OS versions. To verify which OS your Mac is running, select the **Apple**&reg; icon located in the top left-hand corner and then select  **About This Mac**.

1. Open Mac Mail and select **Mail**, and then **Add Account**.

2. You are prompted to select a mail account provider. Select **Exchange**, then click **Continue**.

3. On the next screen, enter your full name, email address, and click **Sign In**.

4. You are presented with the options to **Configure Manually** or **Sign In**. Click **Configure Manually.

    **Note:** We recommend that you configure your account automatically by using [Autodiscover](/how-to/dns-record-definitions/#cname-record). If you set up your account by using Autodiscover, you will click **Sign In** instead of **Configure Manually**.

5. On the next screen, enter your full name, email address, and password, and click **Sign In**.

6. Select the services that you would like to sync such as mail, contacts, calendar, and then click **Done**.

After completing the steps in this article, Mail begins syncing down to your Mac Mail client.

**Note:** If you are prompted for server name settings, please log in to [emailhelp.rackspace.com](https://emailhelp.rackspace.com) with the email address and password you are attempting to set up, for the exact server name settings.
